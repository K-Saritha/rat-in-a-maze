# rat-in-a-maze
This repository contains a C program that simulates a mouse navigating through a maze to find an exit. The program employs a depth-first search (DFS) approach using stacks to explore possible paths and backtrack when it encounters dead ends. The mouse starts from a user-defined position and attempts to reach a predefined end point.
